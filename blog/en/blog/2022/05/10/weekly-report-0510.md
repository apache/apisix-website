## Introduction

Apache APISIX has grown as a community from the first day of open source and has quickly become the most active open source API gateway project in the world. These achievements cannot be achieved without the joint efforts of our community partners.

"If you want to go fast, go alone.If you want to go far, go together." The Apache APISIX Community Weekly Report hopes to help community members better understand the weekly progress of the Apache APISIX community and and facilitate everyone to participate in the Apache APISIX community.

We have also compiled some issues suitable for newcomers to the community to participate in! If you are interested, don't miss it!

## Good first issue

### Issue #6923

**Link**: https://github.com/apache/apisix/issues/6923

**Issue description**:

As a user, I want to let `api-breaker` plugin return the default response body. Refer to the document [api-breaker](https://apisix.apache.org/zh/docs/apisix/plugins/api-breaker/), when upstream is in the unhealthy state, the `api-breaker` returns `unhealthy.http_statuses` only, without a response body.

In order to be more compatible to the client, return a default response body is useful.
