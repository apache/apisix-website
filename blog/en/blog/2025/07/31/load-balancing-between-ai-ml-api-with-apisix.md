> This blog provides a step-by-step guide to configure Apache APISIX for AI traffic splitting and load balancing between API versions, covering security setup, canary testing, and deployment monitoring.

<!--truncate-->

## Overview

[**AI/ML API**](https://aimlapi.com/) is a one-stop, OpenAI-compatible endpoint that is trusted by 150,000+ developers to 300+ state-of-the-art models—chat, vision, image/video/music generation, embeddings, OCR, and more—from Google, Meta, OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, and others.

[**Apache APISIX**](https://github.com/apache/apisix) is a dynamic, real-time, high-performance API Gateway. APISIX API Gateway provides rich traffic management features and can serve as an AI Gateway through its flexible plugin system.

Modern AI workloads often require smooth version migrations, A/B testing, and rolling updates. This guide shows you how to:

1. **Install** Apache APISIX with Docker quickstart.
2. **Secure** the Admin API with keys and IP whitelisting.
3. **Define** separate routes for API versions v1 and v2.
4. **Implement** weighted traffic splitting (50/50) via the `traffic-split` plugin.
5. **Verify** the newly created split endpoint functionality.
6. **Load test** and **monitor** distribution accuracy.

To perform authenticated requests, you'll need an AI/ML API key. You can get one at [https://aimlapi.com/app/keys/](https://aimlapi.com/app/keys?utm_source=apisix&utm_medium=guide&utm_campaign=integration) and use it as a Bearer token in your Authorization headers.

## Quickstart Installation

```bash
# 1. Download and run the quickstart script (includes etcd + APISIX)
curl -sL https://run.api7.ai/apisix/quickstart | sh

# 2. Confirm APISIX is up and running
curl -I http://127.0.0.1:9080 | grep Server
# ➜ Server: APISIX/3.13.0
```

> **Tip:** If you encounter port conflicts, adjust Docker host networking or map to different ports in the quickstart script.

## Secure the Admin API

By default, quickstart bypasses Admin API authentication. For any non-development environment, enforce security:

### 1. Set an Admin Key

Edit `conf/config.yaml` inside the APISIX container or local install directory, replacing the example key with your own API key obtained from the link above:

```yaml
apisix:
  enable_admin: true            # Enable Admin API
  admin_key_required: true      # Reject unauthenticated Admin requests
  admin_key:
    - name: admin
      key: YOUR_ADMIN_KEY_HERE  # Generated admin key - you can replace this with a secure key as you wish
      role: admin
```

> **Security Best Practice:** Use at least 32 characters, mix letters/numbers/symbols, and rotate keys quarterly.

### 2. Whitelist Management IPs (allow\_admin)

Add your management or local networks under the `admin:` section:

```yaml
admin:
  allow_admin:
    - 127.0.0.0/24   # Localhost & host network
    - 0.0.0.0/0      # Allow all (temporary/testing only)
```

> **Warning:** `0.0.0.0/0` opens Admin API to the world! Lock this down to specific subnets in production.

### 3. Restart APISIX

```bash
docker restart apisix-quickstart
```

> **Check Logs:** `docker logs apisix-quickstart --tail 50` to ensure no errors about admin authentication.

## Define Basic Routes for v1 and v2

Before splitting traffic, ensure each version works individually.

### 1. Route for v1

```bash
curl -i http://127.0.0.1:9180/apisix/admin/routes/test-v1 \
  -X PUT \
  -H "X-API-KEY: YOUR_ADMIN_KEY_HERE" \
  -d '{
    "uri": "/test/v1",
    "upstream": {
      "type": "roundrobin",
      "nodes": {"api.aimlapi.com:443": 1},
      "scheme": "https",
      "pass_host": "node"
    }
  }'
```

> **Tip:** Use `id` fields if you want to manage or delete routes easily later.

### 2. Route for v2

```bash
curl -i http://127.0.0.1:9180/apisix/admin/routes/test-v2 \
  -X PUT \
  -H "X-API-KEY: YOUR_ADMIN_KEY_HERE" \
  -d '{
    "uri": "/test/v2",
    "upstream": {
      "type": "roundrobin",
      "nodes": {"api.aimlapi.com:443": 1},
      "scheme": "https",
      "pass_host": "node"
    }
  }'
```

## Implement Traffic Splitting (50/50)

Use the [`traffic-split`](https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/plugins/traffic-split/) plugin for controlled distribution between v1 and v2. In the admin request below, replace `YOUR_ADMIN_KEY_HERE` with your actual key.

```bash
curl -i http://127.0.0.1:9180/apisix/admin/routes/aimlapi-split \
  -X PUT \
  -H "X-API-KEY: YOUR_ADMIN_KEY_HERE" \
  -d '{
    "id": "aimlapi-split",
    "uri": "/chat/completions",
    "upstream": {
      "type": "roundrobin",
      "nodes": {"api.aimlapi.com:443": 1},
      "scheme": "https",
      "pass_host": "node"
    },
    "plugins": {
      "traffic-split": {
        "rules": [
          {
            "weight": 50,
            "upstream": {"type":"roundrobin","nodes":{"api.aimlapi.com:443":1},"scheme":"https","pass_host":"node"},
            "rewrite": {"uri":"/v1/chat/completions"}
          },
          {
            "weight": 50,
            "upstream": {"type":"roundrobin","nodes":{"api.aimlapi.com:443":1},"scheme":"https","pass_host":"node"},
            "rewrite": {"uri":"/v2/chat/completions"}
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }'
```

> **Tip:** Adjust the `weight` values to shift traffic ratios (e.g., 80/20 for canary).
>
> **Note:** `rewrite` must match the internal API path exactly.

## Verify Split Endpoint Functionality

Test the `/chat/completions` endpoint you just created. Replace `<AIML_API_KEY>` with the key obtained earlier and use it as a Bearer token:

```bash
curl -v -X POST http://127.0.0.1:9080/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <AIML_API_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-4","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"ping"}]}'
```

**Expected Output:**

```json
{"content":"Pong! How can I assist you today?"}
```

> **Tip:** Use `-v` for verbose output to troubleshoot headers or TLS issues.

## Load Test & Distribution Validation

After configuring the split route, use the following commands to validate distribution. Replace `<AIML_API_KEY>` with your Bearer token.

```bash
# 1. Send 100 test requests
time seq 100 | xargs -I {} curl -s -o /dev/null -X POST http://127.0.0.1:9080/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <AIML_API_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-4","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"ping"}]}'

# 2. Check APISIX logs for upstream hits (replace IPs with actual resolved IPs)
echo "v1 hits: $(docker logs apisix-quickstart --since 5m | grep -c '188.114.97.3:443')"
echo "v2 hits: $(docker logs apisix-quickstart --since 5m | grep -c '188.114.96.3:443')"
```

**Expected:** Approximately 50 requests to each upstream.

> **Tip:** Use Prometheus or OpenTelemetry plugins for real‑time metrics instead of manual log parsing.

## Best Practices & Next Steps

* **Rate Limiting & Quotas**: Add [`limit-count`](https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/plugins/limit-count/) plugin to protect your upstream from spikes.
* **Authentication**: Layer on the [`key-auth`](https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/plugins/key-auth/) plugin for consumer management.
* **Circuit Breaker**: Prevent cascading failures with the [`api-breaker`](https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/plugins/api-breaker/) plugin.
* **Observability**: Integrate Prometheus, Skywalking, or Loki for dashboards and alerts.
* **Infrastructure as Code**: Consider managing APISIX config via Kubernetes CRDs or ADC for reproducibility.
