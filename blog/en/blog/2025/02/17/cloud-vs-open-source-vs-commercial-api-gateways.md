## Introduction

API gateways have become essential components in modern cloud architectures. They provide security, traffic management, observability, and service orchestrationâ€”critical for handling APIs at scale. However, with multiple API gateway solutions available, choosing the right one can be challenging.

Broadly, API gateways fall into three categories:

- Cloud API Gateways (e.g., Amazon API Gateway, Google Apigee)
- Open Source API Gateways (e.g., Apache APISIX, Kong Gateway, Tyk)
- Commercial API Gateways (e.g., MuleSoft, Boomi)

Each option has its advantages and trade-offs. This article provides a deep dive into their differences, hidden risks, and a strategic recommendation for companies looking to scale API usage and adopt hybrid cloud architectures.
