1. [Support `_meta.pre_function` to execute custom logic before execution of each phase](https://github.com/apache/apisix/pull/11793) (Contributor: [Revolyssup](https://github.com/Revolyssup))

Add `pre_function` to `_meta` of the plugin to allow some personalized code to run before all plugins run. For example, register personalized variables so that these temporary variables can be referenced and used in the plugin.
