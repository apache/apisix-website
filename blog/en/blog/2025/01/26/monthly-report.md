[Support Anonymous Consumer in Authentication](https://github.com/apache/apisix/pull/11917) (Contributor: [Revolyssup](https://github.com/Revolyssup))

The anonymous consumer feature enables selective bypass of authentication requirements by allowing the configuration of an anonymous consumer on authentication plugins. This feature allows protected routes to grant access to non-authenticated callers.
