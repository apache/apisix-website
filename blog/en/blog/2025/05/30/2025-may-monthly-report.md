## Introduction

From its inception, the Apache APISIX project has embraced the ethos of open-source community collaboration, propelling it into the ranks of the most active global open-source API gateway projects. The proverbial wisdom of 'teamwork makes the dream work' rings true in our way and is made possible by the collective effort of our community.

From May 1st to May 30, 8 contributors made 39 commits to Apache APISIX. We sincerely appreciate your contributions to Apache APISIX.

## Feature Highlights

### Add Metadata to Resource Schema

PR: https://github.com/apache/apisix/pull/12224

Contributor: [bzp2010](https://github.com/bzp2010)

This PR refactors the resource schema to ensure that user-facing resources include a standardized `metadata` section with `name`, `desc`, and `labels` fields. This improves consistency and helps resolve issues in downstream projects like APISIX dashboard and APISIX's declarative CLI (ADC).

### Add `lago` Plugin

PR: https://github.com/apache/apisix/pull/12196

Contributor: [bzp2010](https://github.com/bzp2010)

Add `lago` plugin to allow users to use APISIX as a monetization gateway, allowing them to charge subscribers based on API consumption. This can be applied in AI cloud platforms to charge by consumed tokens—similar to OpenAI and Deepseek—or to charge for access to specific APIs, such as monetized weather data services.

### Support Revision in API-Driven Standalone Mode like etcd

PR: https://github.com/apache/apisix/pull/12200

Contributor: [bzp2010](https://github.com/bzp2010)

In standalone mode, APISIX's Admin API requires clients to fetch the entire configuration on every sync. As configurations grow or change frequently, this full-sync mechanism causes excessive network traffic and latency when applying updates. Additionally, frequent resource changes trigger a complete rebuild of the internal radixtree, degrading route lookup performance under high churn. In service discovery scenarios where upstreams are frequently updated, we aim to update only upstream data without impacting other resources.

### Support Health Checks on L4

PR: https://github.com/apache/apisix/pull/12180

Contributor: [nic-6443](https://github.com/nic-6443)

This PR added support for health checks when APISIX is operating as an L4 (stream) proxy.

### Add Standalone Admin API

PR: https://github.com/apache/apisix/pull/12179

Contributor: [bzp2010](https://github.com/bzp2010)

This PR introduces a dedicated Admin API for Standalone mode, enabling users to update in-memory configurations without relying on the file system, further enhancing statelessness. Configurations can be submitted via HTTP PUT in JSON or YAML format. This feature supports use cases like the Ingress Controller by removing the dependency on static configuration files.

## Conclusion
