## Why Do We Need APISIXï¼Ÿ

During the technology selection, we noticed that APISIX is an open-source API gateway that provides high performance, high availability, and scalability. APISIX also supports multiple protocols, including HTTP, WebSocket, gRPC, and various plugins such as rate limiting, authentication, authorization, and logging, making it suitable for various API gateway requirements in different scenarios. Additionally, APISIX has unique advantages in microservices frameworks and cloud-native environments.

We particularly value APISIX for its high performance, dynamic routing capabilities, security protection, and the flexibility of its plugin system.

## Requirements for Large-Scale Video Services

Migu Video faced several challenges in its business scenarios, including high concurrent access, high-security requirements, and fault recovery. The live streaming scenarios are demanding in transmission requirements and require support for multiple formats and protocols, and content delivery acceleration through Content Delivery Network (CDN). These are the characteristics of our business. Luckily, APISIX, as a high-performance solution, can help us address these challenges.

- **High Traffic and High Concurrency**: Video services typically face a large number of user requests and require handling high concurrency situations.

- **High Real-time Requirement**: It is crucial to ensure real-time data transmission and display in live streaming and similar scenarios.

- **Support for Multiple Formats and Protocols**: Video services may involve various video formats and transmission protocols.

- **CDN Acceleration**: To provide a better user experience, video services often make use of CDN for accelerated content delivery.

### APISIX Implementation in Large-Scale Video Services

Next, let's delve into the specific use cases of APISIX in our video service business, focusing on traffic scheduling and management, dynamic routing, and security protection.

- **Traffic Scheduling and Management**: We have been exploring traffic scheduling and management, aiming to control the traffic scheduling and rate limiting, thus avoiding or intercepting certain requests by leveraging APISIX plugins.

- **Dynamic Routing**: Dynamic routing was one of the key features that initially attracted us to APISIX. Previously, our centralized gateway mainly relied on a version of OpenResty. However, due to the frequent changes in our business and routing information, making online modifications to the routing configuration posed certain risks. APISIX, with its dynamic routing and hot configuration through Dashboard, allows us to publish changes without reloading the service, which is highly valuable to us.

- **Security Protection**: We aim to utilize APISIX's security protection features to safeguard our video services from various network attacks effectively. For example, by configuring APISIX's firewall rules, we can filter out malicious requests and ensure the stable operation of our business.

### Gateway Customization Based on APISIX

Currently, Migu Video has completed their customization of 11 sets of gateways, as well as 4 sets of environments waiting for release to the production environments.

These 11 sets of gateways cover the main gateways of our centralized business. For example, there is a public gateway for user login, a user management center gateway responsible for user authentication capabilities, a sales gateway for user product purchases, and the Professional User Generated Content (PUGC) gateway required for the newly added live streaming business in 2023. Additionally, we have also transformed the gateway for cinema ticketing.

The current APISIX gateway environment at Migu generally follows a dual-data center architecture. Each data center has multiple APISIX services, a set of etcd clusters with 3 nodes typically, and a Dashboard service for frontend route configuration. Additionally, we use self-developed signature verification and token verification plugins, mainly for gateway signature and token validation.

### Useful Plugins

In addition to our self-developed plugins, we also utilize the built-in Prometheus and Grafana plugins provided by APISIX, primarily for monitoring the APISIX gateway.

Except that, during the initial deployment of APISIX, we received technical support from the original manufacturer-API7.ai. They assisted us in conducting inspections in the production environment and addressed various issues. This included adjustments to plugins and resource allocation, resolving potential issues that may have been encountered in the live environment.

### Monitoring and Alerting

Apart from some aided monitoring solutions, we mostly use Prometheus and Grafana.

Prometheus and Grafana are official plugins provided by APISIX. We primarily use them to monitor metrics such as error rates, latency, TPS, the health of the etcd clusters, shared memory status, and message-sending rate within the APISIX gateway.

These metrics are typically displayed in visual charts, providing a more intuitive and clear view of the system's performance.

## APISIX Adaptation for Other Operating Systems

To enhance the competitiveness of our group, we needed to use many other operating systems, during which we encountered some challenges.

- **Environment Differences**: Due to certain differences among Windows, Unix, Linux, and other operating systems, we had to make adjustments for compatibility with different dependency libraries

- **Package Management**: Owing to the customized dependency packages of various operating systems, we needed to reconfigure some foundational software packages to ensure compatibility.

- **Performance**: Initially, we were unsure about the performance of APISIX on a new operating system. Therefore, we conducted several testing phases.

First, we adapted APISIX to the operating system in a test environment and resolved any dependency package-related issues. Then, we conducted stress testing on a set of PUGC gateways. This business has already been extensively deployed in our services during the Four International Competitions in 2023, including the Hangzhou Asian Games, the Summer World University Games in Chengdu, the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup, and the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup.

Currently, the practical testing of APISIX on the new operating system has proved that APISIX can perfectly  meet our business requirements by handling many concurrent live-streaming sessions on the new operating system.

### Strategic Development Approach: Containerizing APISIX

One of our development strategies is to containerize APISIX. Currently, our main environment is based on VM, but we plan to transition to Kubernetes (K8s) in the future. Considering that many gateways within Migu have already migrated into APISIX, we have chosen the APISIX Ingress Controller as our gateway for containerization.

Currently, our VM environment is based on LVS (Linux Virtual Server), but we expect to transition to using the APISIX Ingress Controller in a containerized environment.

The containerization plan will be conducted in two steps. First, due to the high stability requirements of our business, we may initially replace some services, allowing VM and containerized environments to coexist. Then, we will enable a gradual migration from VM to containerization.
