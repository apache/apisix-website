> We have recently made fixes and improvements to certain features of Apache APISIX and APISIX Ingress Controller. These include providing native JSON data structure input support for the wasm plugin, adding UNIX socket listening support for the `chaitin-waf` plugin, and introducing the ability to remove the etcd dependency required by APISIX within the APISIX Ingress to reduce architectural complexity. For more details, please refer to the biweekly report.

## Introduction

Apache APISIX grew up as a community from the first day it was open-sourced, and quickly became the most active open-source API gateway project in the world. These achievements are inseparable from the joint efforts of community partners.

We have recently fixed and improved some features, and the summary of the updates is as follows:

1. Provide native JSON data structure input support for the wasm plugin

2. Add UNIX socket listening support for the `chaitin-waf` plugin
