**Problem Description**: I am having problems trying to download Apache APISIX version 2.9 on a Macbook with M1 system according to the related guide article. The prompt is as follows.

```Apache
lualogging 1.5.2-1 depends on luasocket (3.0rc1-2 installed)

Installing https://luarocks.org/lrexlib-pcre-2.9.1-1.src.rock

Error: Failed installing dependency: https://luarocks.org/casbin-1.26.0-1.rockspec - Failed installing dependency: https://luarocks.org/lrexlib-pcre-2.9.1-1.src.rock - Could not find header file for PCRE
