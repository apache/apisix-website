## Introduction to the topic

### Apache APISIX based, iQiYi API gateway implementation practice

#### Sharing Guests

Wenjie Jiang / Scientist, iQiYi

#### Topic Details

API gateway has become an indispensable part of microservice architecture. It is the only portal for services to the outside world, but also needs to meet the common functions of many applications. As an online video company, Aqiyi needs to carry tens of millions of calls every day and has extremely strict requirements for data security, user request response time, and system stability, so the company needs to build a high-performance and highly available API gateway. This article briefly introduces the architecture of iQiYi API gateway and the functions implemented, including request distribution, conditional routing, API management, flow-limiting fusion, security triple prevention, monitoring and alarming, and full-link tracking.

### How to use Apache APISIX for centralized authentication

#### Sharing Guests

Xinxin Zhu / api7.ai Engineer, Apache APISIX Committer

#### Topic Details

Authentication is a very important part of zero-trust architecture. APISIX is a dynamic, real-time, high-performance API gateway that supports a rich set of authentication plugins.

### Data Sovereignty and Apache APISIX Gateway Landing Practice

#### Sharing Guests

Yang Li / Head of Airwallex Technology Platform

#### Topic Details

Data is everywhere, and massive amounts of data are being processed, transmitted, and stored all over the world every moment. However, the world of data is not a place outside the law, and the collection and processing of data must comply with the laws of each country. The API gateway has a special position in the enterprise architecture and therefore plays a special role in the data sovereignty scenario.

### The One Who Walks Alone Goes Fast, The Many Who Walk Far, Apache APISIX Thanks to You

#### Sharing Guests

Yansheng Wang / Co-founder & CTO of api7.ai

#### Topic Details

Apache APISIX has been growing as a community since the first day of open source. In just two years, the product has won the first place in many technical indicators and quickly become the most active API gateway project in the world, and has defined the path that belongs to Apache APISIX: unified 7-layer traffic processing. One person can go fast, but a group of people can go farther, and we are grateful to you for the growth of Apache APISIX.
