## Introduction

Apache APISIX has grown as a community since the first day of open source and has quickly become the most active open source API gateway project in the world. These achievements could not have been achieved without the joint efforts of our community partners.

"If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together", Apache APISIX Community Weekly Report hopes to help community members better grasp the weekly progress of the Apache APISIX community and facilitate your participation in the Apache APISIX community.

We've also put together some issues for those new to the community!

## Good first issue

### Issue #5165

**Link**: https://github.com/apache/apisix/issues/5165

**Problem Description**:

- When a browser publishes across domains and then displays a CORS error, the login for the `wolf-rbac` plugin `url/apisix/plugin/wolf-rbac/login` returns `json` format, but the `header` gives a content type of `text/plain`, please change the content type to `application/json` after the plugin login.

- The login for `wolf-rabc` `uri/apisix/plugin/wolf-rbac/login` will lose the CORS plugin with the added header.

### Issue #5192

**Link**: https://github.com/apache/apisix/issues/5192

**Problem Description**: When installing APISIX dependencies, different Linux distributions will have different executions. Is it possible to merge these different executions into "install-dependencise.sh" to make it easier for users to install dependencies?
