In January 2020 Apache APISIX released version 1.0, the first production version of Apache APISIX. Late last month Apache APISIX released the latest version [2.10.0](https://apisix.apache.org/zh/blog/2021/09/29/release-apache-apisix-2.10/), which is the 24th release of Apache APISIX. The Apache APISIX community maintains a fast and steady pace, with **a new release every month**. Every discussion, every PR, and every milestone of Apache APISIX is dependent on the participation of its contributors.

There is no barrier to becoming an Apache APISIX contributor, and the Apache APISIX community includes not only contributions of code, but also documentation, testing, design, making videos, and more. Raising PRs or issues on Github, participating in discussions on mailing lists, sharing via live streams, helping people solve problems in networking groups, and attending Meetups are all ways to get involved in the community. Welcome to the Apache APISIX community!
