>My ideas for blog posts inevitably start to dry up after over two years at [Apache APISIX](https://apisix.apache.org/). Hence, I did some triage on the [APISIX repo](https://github.com/apache/apisix/issues). I stumbled upon this one question:

<!--truncate-->

>We have a requirement to use a plugin, where we need to route the traffic on percentage basis. I'll give an example for better understanding.
>
>We have an URL <https://xyz.com/ca/fr/index.html> where ca is country (canada) and fr is french language. Now the traffic needs to routed 10% to <https://xyz.com/ca/en/index.html> and the remaining 90% to <https://xyz.com/ca/fr/index.html>. And whenever we're routing the traffic to <https://xyz.com/ca/en/index.html> we need to set a cookie. So for next call, if the cookie is there, it should directly go to <https://xyz.com/ca/en/index.html> else it should go via a 10:90 traffic split. What is the best possible way to achieve this ??

>-- [help request: Setting cookie based on a condition](https://github.com/apache/apisix/issues/11279)

The use case is interesting, and I decided to tackle it.

I'll rephrase the requirements first:

* If no cookie is set, randomly forward the request to one of the upstreams
* If a cookie has been set, forward the request to the correct upstream.

For easier testing:

* I change the odds from 10:90 to 50:50
* I use the root instead of a host plus a path

Finally, I assume that the upstream sets the cookie.

Newcomers to Apache APISIX understand the matching algorithm very quickly: if a request matches a route's host, method, and path, forward it to the upstream set.

```yaml
routes:
  - id: 1
    uri: /hello
    host: foo.com
    methods:
      - GET
      - PUT
      - POST
    upstream_id: 1
```

```bash
curl --resolve foo.com:127.0.0.1 http://foo.com/hello            #1
curl -X POST --resolve foo.com:127.0.0.1 http://foo.com/hello    #2
curl -X PUT --resolve foo.com:127.0.0.1 http://foo.com/hello     #2
curl --resolve bar.com:127.0.0.1 http://bar.com/hello            #3
curl --resolve foo.com:127.0.0.1 http://foo.com/hello/john       #4
```

1. Matches host, method as `curl` defaults to `GET`, and path
2. Matches host, method, and path
3. Doesn't match host
4. Doesn't match path as the configured path doesn't hold a `*` character

`path` is the only required parameter; neither `host` nor `methods` are. `host` defaults to any host and `methods` to any method.

Beyond these three main widespread matching parameters, others are available, _e.g._, `remote_addrs` or `vars`. Let's focus on the latter. The documentation on the Route API is pretty concise:

>Matches based on the specified variables consistent with variables in Nginx. Takes the form `[[var, operator, val], [var, operator, val], ...]]`. Note that this is case sensitive when matching a cookie name. See [lua-resty-expr](https://github.com/api7/lua-resty-expr) for more details.

One can only understand `vars` in the Router Radix Tree documentation. The Router Radix Tree powers the Apache APISIX's matching engine.

>Nginx provides a variety of built-in variables that can be used to filter routes based on certain criteria. Here is an example of how to filter routes by Nginx built-in variables:

>This route will require the request header `host` equal `iresty.com`, request cookie key `_device_id` equal `a66f0cdc4ba2df8c096f74c9110163a9`, etc.  You can learn more at [radixtree-new](https://github.com/api7/lua-resty-radixtree#new).

Among all Nginx variables, we can find `$cookie_xxx`. Hence, we can come up with the following configuration:

```yaml
routes:
  - name: Check for French cookie
    uri: /
    vars: [[ "cookie_site", "==", "fr" ]]             #1
    upstream_id: 1
  - name: Check for English cookie
    uri: /
    vars: [[ "cookie_site", "==", "en" ]]             #2
    upstream_id: 2
```

1. Match if a cookie named `site` has value `fr`
2. Match if a cookie named `site` has value `en`

We need to configure the final route, the one used when no cookie is set. We use the `traffic-split` plugin to assign a route randomly.

>The `traffic-split` Plugin can be used to dynamically direct portions of traffic to various Upstream services.
>
>This is done by configuring `match`, which are custom rules for splitting traffic, and `weighted_upstreams` which is a set of Upstreams to direct traffic to.
>
>When a request is matched based on the `match` attribute configuration, it will be directed to the Upstreams based on their configured `weights`. You can also omit using the `match` attribute and direct all traffic based on `weighted_upstreams`.
>
>-- [traffic-split](https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/plugins/traffic-split/)

The third route is the following:

```yaml
  - name: Let the fate decide
    uri: /
    upstream_id: 1                                    #1
    plugins:
      traffic-split:
        rules:
          - weighted_upstreams:
              - weight: 50                            #1
              - upstream_id: 2                        #2
                weight: 50                            #2
```

1. The weight of the upstream `1` is `50`
2. The upstream `2` weight is also `50` out of the total weight sum. It's a half-half chance of APISIX forwarding it to either upstream

At this point, we need to solve one remaining issue: the order in which APISIX will evaluate the routes. When routes' paths are disjoint, the order plays no role; when they are overlapping, it does.

For example, if APISIX evaluates the last route first, it will forward the request to a random upstream, even though a cookie might have been set. We need to force the evaluation of the first two routes first. For that, APISIX offers the `priority` parameter; its value is `0` by default. It evaluates routes matching by order of decreasing priority. We need to override it to evaluate the random route last.

```yaml
  - name: Let the fate decide
    uri: /
    upstream_id: 1
    priority: -1
#...
```

You can try the setup in a browser or with `curl`. With curl, we can set the "first" request like this:

```bash
curl -v localhost:9080
```

If the upstream sets the cookie correctly, you should see the following line among the different response headers:

```
Set-Cookie: site=fr
```

Since curl doesn't store cookies by default, the value should change across several calls. If we set the cookie, the value stays constant:

```bash
curl -v --cookie 'site=en' localhost:9080                  #1
```

1. The cookie name is case-sensitive; beware

The browser keeps the cookie, so it's even simpler. Just go to <http:localhost:9080> and refresh several times: the content is the same as well. The content will change if you change the cookie to another possible value and request again.
