## Recent Feature Highlights

1. [Refactor `google-cloud-logging` Plugin](https://github.com/apache/apisix/pull/11596) (Contributor: [HuanXin-Chen](https://github.com/HuanXin-Chen))

This PR changed `scope` into `scopes` according to OAuth2/OIDC rules. It also replaced `google-cloud-logging/oauth.lua` with `utils/google-cloud-oauth.lua`.

2. [Add `ai-content-moderation` Plugin](https://github.com/apache/apisix/pull/11541) (Contributor: [shreemaan-abhishek](https://github.com/shreemaan-abhishek))

The `ai-prompt-decorator` plugin simplifies access to LLM providers, such as OpenAI and Anthropic, and their models by appending or prepending prompts into the request.

3. [Add `ai-rag` Plugin](https://github.com/apache/apisix/pull/11568)ï¼ˆContributor: [shreemaan-abhishek](https://github.com/shreemaan-abhishek))

Implement the `ai-rag` plugin that uses RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), to return information about untrained events/facts from LLMs.

4. [Add Total Request Panel in Grafana Dashboard](https://github.com/apache/apisix/pull/11692) (Contributor: [Revolyssup](https://github.com/Revolyssup))

As the Grafana dashboard only has panels for RPS per status code and RPS per service/route, this PR also adds a total RPS panel for the overview of RPS changes.

5. [Use `setmetatable` to Set Hidden Variables without Effecting Serialisation in `body-transformer` Plugin](https://github.com/apache/apisix/pull/11770) (Contributor: [Revolyssup](https://github.com/Revolyssup))

Users hope to directly use the decoded body in the template of `body-transformer` plugin, modify its fields, and then encode it again.

6. [Support configuring `key_claim_name` in `jwt-auth` Plugin](https://github.com/apache/apisix/pull/11772) (Contributor: [shreemaan-abhishek](https://github.com/shreemaan-abhishek))

Configuring `key_claim_name` in the JWT plugin is essential for specifying which claim in the JWT contains the key that identifies the secret used for validating the token.

7. [Suppress Error Log in Multi-Authentication When One Authentication Succeeds](https://github.com/apache/apisix/pull/11775) (Contributor: [shreemaan-abhishek](https://github.com/shreemaan-abhishek))

When using multiple authentication plugins, even if one authentication plugin passes verification while others fail, an error log is still recorded, which can confuse the user. This PR fixes the logic so that if any one of the authentication plugins passes, no error log will be recorded.

The [official website](https://apisix.apache.org/) and [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/apache/apisix/issues) of Apache APISIX provide a wealth of documentation of tutorials and real-world use cases. If you encounter any issues, you can refer to the documentation, search for keywords in Issues, or participate in discussions on Issues to share your ideas and practical experiences.
