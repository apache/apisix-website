## Introduction

From its inception, the Apache APISIX project has embraced the ethos of open-source community collaboration, propelling it into the ranks of the most active global open-source API gateway projects. The proverbial wisdom of 'teamwork makes the dream work' rings true in our way and is made possible by the collective effort of our community.

From July 1 to June 31, a total of 13 contributors made 21 commits to Apache APISIX. We sincerely appreciate your contributions to Apache APISIX.

## Recent Feature Highlight

- [Move `config-default.yaml` default values to hardcoded Lua file](https://github.com/apache/apisix/pull/11312)ï¼ˆContributor: [bzp2010](https://github.com/bzp2010))

  Apache APISIX has two configuration files: `config.yaml` which can be modified by users and `config-default.yaml`, the default configuration file. When APISIX starts, it reads these two configuration files and merges and overwrites the user configuration file with the default configuration to create the configuration that is used at runtime.
  
  However, in actual use, users are often unclear on how to modify custom configurations. To simplify the configuration process and avoid unintended issues from modifying the default file, we moved the default configuration values to a hardcoded Lua file. This allows users to focus on customizing the `config.yaml` file without the risk of accidentally changing the default settings.
