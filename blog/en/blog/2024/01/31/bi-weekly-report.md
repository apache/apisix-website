  Author: Xiaobiao Zhao, DataVisor Senior Architect, Apache Kvrocks Committer, OpenResty and Apache APISIX Contributor. This article is based on a presentation given by Xiaobiao Zhao at the APISIX Shanghai Meetup in November 2023.

- [Apache APISIX plugin priority, a leaky abstraction?](https://apisix.apache.org/blog/2023/12/14/apisix-plugins-priority-leaky-abstraction/)

  Apache APISIX builds upon the OpenResty reverse-proxy to offer a plugin-based architecture. The main benefit of such an architecture is that it brings structure to the configuration of routes. It's a help at scale, when managing hundreds or thousands of routes.

A wealth of documentation tutorials and experience has been accumulated on the Apache APISIX official website and GitHub. If you encounter problems, you can look into the documentation, search keywords in the issues, or participate in the discussion on the issues, proposing your own ideas and practical experience.
