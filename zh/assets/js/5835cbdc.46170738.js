Newton\'s Second Law of Motion - Force and Acceleration: The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. This is usually formulated as F=ma where F is the force applied, m is the mass of the object and a is the acceleration produced.\\n\\n3. Newton\'s Third Law - Action and Reaction: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that any force exerted on a body will create a force of equal magnitude but in the opposite direction on the object that exerted the first force.\\n\\nIn simple terms: \\n1.

If no net force acts on an object, its velocity (speed and direction) will not change.\\n- **Example**: A book lying on a table will stay at rest unless you push it.

Newton\'s laws of motion are three fundamental principles that describe the relationship between the motion of an object and the forces acting on it.

Newton\'s First Law (Law of Inertia):**\\n- **Statement:** An object at rest will remain at rest, and an object in motion will continue moving at a constant velocity (in a straight line at a constant speed), unless acted upon by an external force.\\n- **Key Idea:** This law introduces the concept of **inertia**, which is the tendency of an object to resist changes in its state of motion.\\n- **Example:** If you slide a book across a table, it eventually stops because of the force of friction acting on it. Without friction, the book would keep moving indefinitely.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **2. Newton\'s Second Law (Law of Acceleration):**\\n- **Statement:** The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass.

In simple words, this law suggests that an object will keep doing whatever it is doing until something causes it to do otherwise. \\n\\n2) Newton\'s Second Law states that the force acting on an object is equal to the mass of that object times its acceleration (F=ma). This means that force is directly proportional to mass and acceleration. The heavier the object and the faster it accelerates, the greater the force.\\n\\n3) Newton\'s Third Law, also known as the law of action and reaction, states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Essentially, any force exerted onto a body will create a force of equal magnitude but in the opposite direction on the object that exerted the first force.\\n\\nRemember, these laws become less accurate when considering speeds near the speed of light (where Einstein\'s theory of relativity becomes more appropriate) or objects very small or very large.
