Apache APISIX is a project maintained by community members under the Apache Software Foundation.
It is an open-source project that abides by the [Apache Software Foundation's code of conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct.html). Apache APISIX is a dynamic, real-time, high-performance Cloud-Native API Gateway. It handles traditional north-south traffic, as well as east-west traffic between services.
