Apache APISIX is an open-source project developed and maintained by a friendly community of users, contributors, committers, and project management committee (PMC) members.

Everyone is welcome to join and contribute to the project in multiple ways, not only with code contributions. Contributions like asking questions, reporting bugs, proposing new features, improving documentation, adding to the website, organizing events, or writing blog posts among other contributions, are welcome and recognized.

This document is a guide for new members of the APISIX community to get started with contributing to the projects.

## Become a Committer

If you become a valuable contributor to the project you may be invited to become a Committer. A Committer is a term used at the [ASF](https://www.apache.org/) to mean someone who is committed to a particular project.

Committers are community members that have a write access to the project’s repositories (i.e., they can modify the code, documentation, and website by themselves and also assist with code reviews and accept other contributions).

Learn more about how to [become an Apache APISIX committer](https://apisix.apache.org/docs/general/committer-guide/#how-do-i-become-an-apache-apisix-committer).

Are you already contributing actively last 6 months?

Please, claim to become a Committer here.

## Become a Project Management Committee (PMC) Member

The PMC is the official managing body of the project as per the Apache Software Foundation governance model: “The Apache Way”. PMC members vote to set Apache Apisix’s community and technical direction and are directly responsible for overseeing releases and the healthy development of the community.

PMC members are also responsible for ensuring their project follows certain core requirements set by the board or other corporate officers of the ASF, like following Legal, Branding, and Infrastructure related requirements, along with ensuring their community operates within the [ASF Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct#code-of-conduct).

A PMC member is also a committer, so if they are not initiated already, they will automatically become committers when joining the PMC. Therefore, the traits of Apache APISIX committers also apply to PMC members.
