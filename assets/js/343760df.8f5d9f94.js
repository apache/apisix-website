Although this was a new product for us, it was already being used by so many quality customers that we decided to look into the security aspects of Apache APISIX to see if it was reliable and if there were any security vulnerabilities. Then we discovered that there was a fixed token issue that would allow a malicious attacker to take direct control of the API gateway and affect normal business operations.
