While GitHub already has a number of metrics, such as Star count, Issue count, and PR count, none of these metrics can visually reflect the trends and activity of an open source project over time. So Yiyiyimu proposed new metrics, such as contributor growth and monthly active contributors, and created an open-source tool called the Contributor Graph that allows GitHub users to use these metrics to identify how active a project is. Currently, the Contributor Graph is used in many other used in open source projects.","date":"2021-08-14T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 14, 2021","tags":[{"label":"Community","permalink":"/blog/tags/community"}],"readingTime":4.49,"truncated":true,"authors":[{"name":"Lien","url":"https://github.com/lilien1010","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3814966?v=4"}],"prevItem":{"title":"Using the Apache APISIX OpenID Connect Plugin for Okta Centralized Authentication","permalink":"/blog/2021/08/16/Using-the-Apache-APISIX-OpenID-Connect-Plugin-for-Centralized-Authentication"},"nextItem":{"title":"Chaos Mesh Helps Apache APISIX Improve System Stability","permalink":"/blog/2021/08/12/Chaos-Mesh-Helps-Apache-APISIX-Improve-System-Stability"}}},{"id":"Chaos Mesh Helps Apache APISIX Improve System Stability","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2021/08/12/Chaos-Mesh-Helps-Apache-APISIX-Improve-System-Stability","source":"@site/blog/2021/08/12/Chaos-Mesh-Helps-Apache-APISIX-Improve-System-Stability.md","title":"Chaos Mesh Helps Apache APISIX Improve System Stability","description":"This article explains how system stability create some pain points in different scenarios.
